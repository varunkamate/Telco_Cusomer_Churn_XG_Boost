📞 Telco Customer Churn Prediction
A Streamlit web application that predicts customer churn for a telecommunications company. The app uses a pre-trained XGBoost model to analyze customer data and provides a real-time prediction based on user-input features.

===============================================================

📌 Project Objective
Build an interactive web application using Streamlit.

Utilize a pre-trained machine learning model (model.pkl) to make predictions.

Allow users to input customer data (e.g., tenure, monthly charges, contract type) through a clean user interface.

Provide a clear churn prediction (Yes/No) and its probability.
